# Project 3
+ By: *Nicolas Vogelpoth*
+ Production URL: <http://p3.bookrunner.de>

## Outside resources
+ For input form styling and grid layouts: [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/)
+ To round numbers: [PHP Round Function](http://php.net/manual/de/function.round.php)
+ To handle floating rate inputs: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number)
+ For debugging on the local machine: [Debug-Bar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)

## Code style divergences
+ In a few cases, my PHP code extended beyond 80 characters.

## Notes for instructor
+ I recreated the application which I executed for project 2. However, instead of submitting to itself ([form design flow C](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2018/blob/master/php/forms.md#version-c)) I now submit the form to a new result page ([form design flow A](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2018/blob/master/php/forms.md#version-a)).
